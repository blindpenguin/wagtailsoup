# Wagtail Soup

A simple base project for new Wagtail websites. Still WIP and i'm an idiot at work, so use at your own risk.

## What's included

Coming soon...

## Installation

Clone it, create env, change the name or whatever, install requirements and go on

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blindpenguin/finblick.git <projectname>
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Docker is in its base configuration. If you want to use that weird thing, you'll have to fix that yourself. I'm not touching it. :P
